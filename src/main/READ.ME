This project is all about a "normal" day in the life of a kid in school.
It all starts leaving the house, and you have to leave to go to school.
You run into a dog, and from user input and randomness you make it to school.
After your time at school you meet up with some friends, here you get 2/3 endings.
Then you meet up at the park and have a run in with the police, what do you do?
Once home you play and instrument and then go to bed.
With other outcomes, and more to explore, time goes on and you have to make multiple decisions.
This is more similar to a choose your own adventure, even if many stories overlap, every decision is your own.
